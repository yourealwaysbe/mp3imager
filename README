A quick and dirty python script for automatically downloading and embedding
images into your mp3 files.

Provided with no guarantee it won't mess up all of your files...

Simply searches lastfm/amazon for artist + album title, and attaches the first
hit.  Gets some strange results sometimes.  Last FM is default, but see the code
to see how to enable amazon instead.

Requires:
    
    python 3
    curl
    find
    stagger for python

Usage:

    mp3imager <base-mp3-dir>

Will try to attach an image to every mp3 in a subdirectory of the given
directory.  Also saves an image in the directory containing the mp3.
